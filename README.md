# genomicPCA
 
In this repository, we present a method we call Genomic PCA to derive GWAS summary statistics for a genetic principal component of multiple GWAS phenotypes derived from samples of unknown degrees of overlap using univariate summary statistics for the individual phenotypes. 

On this website https://annafurtjes.github.io/genomicPCA/ we demonstrate a reproducible step-by-step procedure of how to implement genomicPCA.
